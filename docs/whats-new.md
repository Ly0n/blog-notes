### Reading

#### How to Work from Home

I've promised myself that [I'm going to read this today...](https://haacked.com/archive/2020/03/03/how-to-work-from-home/)
> Did a global pandemic spur your bosses to allow you to work from home? Here's a guide to working from home effectively for those who are just starting out.

From Scott Hanselman - [Take Remote Worker/Educator webcam video calls to the next level with OBS, NDI Tools, and Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TakeRemoteWorkerEducatorWebcamVideoCallsToTheNextLevelWithOBSNDIToolsAndElgatoStreamDeck.aspx)

### Tools

#### Kubeval

[Kubeval](https://kubeval.instrumenta.dev/) can be used to validate Kubernetes configuration files and Helm charts (e.g. for catching resource namespaces changes when there's a new Kubernetes version).

To install to windows using [Scoop](/misc/scoop)

```powershell
scoop bucket add instrumenta https://github.com/instrumenta/bucket-instrumenta
scoop install kubeval
```

#### Zeplin

[Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/why-zeplin) is a tool for 'curating designs in the cloud' as a team. Share, organize and collaborate on designs 'built with developers in mind'.

#### Career Tools

My pal [Martin Short](https://mashort.github.io/) shared this with me this week:

[10 Extraordinary GitHub Repos for All Developers](https://medium.com/better-programming/10-extraordinary-github-repos-for-all-developers-939cdeb28ad0)

I particularly like, and need to go back to the [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).

#### Dependabot
