## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment

Install: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>

I found some really handy notes here: <https://jwendl.net/code-notes/wsl/install/>

As always, Scott Hanselman has the low-down to end all low-downs:

- [Cool tips & tricks for WSL](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CoolWSLWindowsSubsystemForLinuxTipsAndTricksYouOrIDidntKnowWerePossible.aspx)
- [Shiny Linux Dev Environment](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/SettingUpAShinyDevelopmentEnvironmentWithinLinuxOnWindows10.aspx)
- [How to make a pretty prompt in Windows Terminal](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToMakeAPrettyPromptInWindowsTerminalWithPowerlineNerdFontsCascadiaCodeWSLAndOhmyposh.aspx)

    See my page on [Scoop & Co.](../misc/scoop.md) for how to quickly and easily install `Delugia Nerd Font` mentioned in Scott's pretty prompt post above
